# Collaby Open API

The open API allows developers to integrate Collaby's features into their software.

# Authentication
Collaby users will login via a login page provided by Collaby. User login in your app will work like this:
  1. Redirect the user to the login page
  2. Collaby will redirect a logged in user back to your app
  3. Your app will recieve a token
  4. Your app exchanges this token for an API access code
  5. Now you have full access to the API
