# Register app

[Register Your Application >](https://collaby.net/api/)

The open API allows developers to integrate Collaby's features into their software.

# Authentication
Collaby users will login via a login page provided by Collaby. Logging in only takes 3 steps. User login in your app will work like this:

  1. Redirect the user to the login page
  2. Collaby will redirect a logged in user back to your app and your app will recieve a temporary code
  3. Your app exchanges this code for an API access code
 
Now you have full access to the API.

### 1. Redirect to login

##### Request

**`GET https://collaby.net/api/auth/{client_id}/`**

### 2. Back to app

Make sure to check if the random string matches your saved random string, otherwise, cancel the login.
